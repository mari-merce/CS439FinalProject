The dataset "merged_data.csv" was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyankraval/nurse-stress-prediction-wearable-sensors/data). 
This, in turn, is a version of the data available from the Nature article "A multimodal sensor dataset for continuous stress detection of nurses in a hospital".
