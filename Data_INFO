The dataset I used was "merged_data.csv", it is uploaded to Google Drive. The link is on CodeBench and here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qoKG7Rh4v6Zk75DlaqmGRZPkx7ASUqLf/view?usp=sharing

The dataset "merged_data.csv" was taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/priyankraval/nurse-stress-prediction-wearable-sensors/data). 

This, in turn, is a version of the data available from the Nature article "A multimodal sensor dataset for continuous stress detection of nurses in a hospital".
